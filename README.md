Chewy Price Scraper

This project uses Python, BeautifulSoup, and requests to scrape information from a product listing on the petpply website www.chewy.com. The code is automated to scrape the price of a specific product once a day. The scraped data is stored locally in a csv file.

The bulk of this project is based on the code created by user AlexTheAnalyst on GitHub for the project "Amazon Web Scraper Project." I have modified the code to adapt it to another platform and to fix several bugs related to issues I was having on my machine.
